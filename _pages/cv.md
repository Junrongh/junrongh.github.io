Work experience
======
* KooLab, Hangzhou Manycore Tech Co., Ltd
  * Research Engineer, 2018.07-2020.05
  * Senior Research Engineer, 2020.05-present
  * Web Rendering Team Manager, 2021.07-present

Research
======
* Research member of ZJU-Kujiale Joint Lab of CG&AI 
  * Material BRDF presentation mappings among different renderer.
    - In order to exchange material seamlessly among between renderer and applications, we proposed a appearance driven method for approximate translation of material BRDFs
    - Result: Built a system for converting v-ray BRDFVRayMtl into standard PBR material; more than 30 million materials in product environment have been processed.
  * High Dimensional Neural Graphics Primitives for NeRF Applications (in process, targeting Sig'23)
    - Given high degree of freedom representation of 3D scene, including light properties, complicated material BRDF, search a NeRF representation for interactive rendering.
