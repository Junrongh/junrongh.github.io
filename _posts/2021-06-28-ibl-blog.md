This is a place holder for ibl system in WebGL. It will include content about technical implementation, such as how to generate pre-filtered radiance map and spherical-harmonics irradiance value, how to pack them in texture cube lod using WebGL api and extensions, how to backup if specific extension not available for certain devices.
