The new technique enables real-time display of radiance fields with impressive visual quality, achieving a rendering rate of at least 30 frames per second. The researchers depict scenes using precise 3D Gaussians, facilitating efficient optimization processes. 

The inclusion of visibility-aware rendering accelerates training, matching the speed of the fastest prior methods while maintaining comparable quality. Additionally, just one extra hour of training enhances the output to a state-of-the-art level of quality.

"First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets."
