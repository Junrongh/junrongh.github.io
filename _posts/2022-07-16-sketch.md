Data-driven Sketch Interpretation
======

ill-posed, requiring additional cues beyond input 2D sketches, such cues might be in existing sketch /image/model data to data-driven approaches

- What is a sketch represent: sketch recognition
- What components constitute a sketched object: sketch segmentation & lableling
- What is underlying 3D shape: 3D interpretation
- What is the underlying photo-realistic object: sketch-based image generation

## Data-driven Sketch Recognition

#### Sketch-a-Net [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07873)][[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.07873.pdf)] by Yu et al. [IJCV 2017], CNN model

stroke removal: handle different levels of abstraction

sketch deformation: handle different levels of deformation

accuracy: 77.95% on TU-Berlin, surpassing human performance([Eitz etal. SIGGRAPH 2012])

#### Sketch-R2CNN [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08170)][[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08170.pdf)] by Li et al [TVCG]

An RNN-Rasterization-CNN architecture for vector sketch recognition

Use an RNN for extracting per-point features in the vector space
Introduce a differentiable Neural Line Rasterization module to connect the vector space and the pixel splace for end-to-end learning

#### Context-based Sketch Classification [[paper](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/files/28603466/SketchCoClass.pdf)] by Zhang et al. [Expressive 2018]

**individual** object can be **ambiguous** to recognize, **context** information can be very useful

Scene can be split into object but we dont know their lables. By CNN and realistic photos' relation graph ,we can use compatibility function to help the co-classification

## 3D Interpretations of Sketches

### Reconstruction-based

- Use sketches as hard constraints
- Employ a less constrained shape space

#### 3D Shape Reconstruction from Sketches via Multi-view Convolutional Networks [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06375?context=cs)][[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06375)] by Lun etal. [3DV 2017]

#### Interactive Sketch-Based Normal Map Generation with Deep Neural Networks [[paper](https://shizhezhou.github.io/projects/sketch2NormalMap/a22-Su.pdf)] by Su et al. [i3D 2018]

### Approximatio-based

- Use sketches as soft constrains
- Employ a more constrained shape space

#### SAniHead [[project](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/publications/sanihead(3df6a49c-402f-48d9-b586-7579924aee8d).html)] by Du et al. [TVCG 2020]

Shape space: largely constrained by the deformation o a template mesh, Less sensitive to erros in input sketches

#### Deep Sketch Hair [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07198)][[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07198)] by Shen et al. [TVCG 2020]

![sketch-a-net](/files/images/posts/Deep-Sketch-Hair.png)

Difficult to synthesize hair details due to the adopted orientation fields

## Sketch-based Image Generation


#### Sketch Hair Salon [[project](https://chufengxiao.github.io/SketchHairSalon/)][[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07874.pdf)] by Xiao et al. [SIGGRAPH Asia 2021]

A traditional pipeline for sketch-based hair synthese/modeling:

sketch -> orientation map -> hair image/model

Using Orientation maps are not very effective to encode complex hair structures, the stroke generated from orientation maps are difficult to get the meaningful sketches
Instead of using orientation map, we try to predict the hair images directly from the hair sketch

![sketch-a-net](/files/images/posts/Sketch-Hair-Salon1.png)

S2M-Net: predict the hair mask

![sketch-a-net](/files/images/posts/Sketch-Hair-Salon2.png)


Using dataset: 4.5K hair image-sketch pairs


#### Deep Generation of Face Images from Sketches [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01047.pdf)] by Chen et al. [SIGGRAPH 2020]

Generate photo-realistic face image from sketches.

Use the manifold projection: we assume the space is locally linear that we can perform locally embedding to refine a input sketch. Given a input feature vector corresponding to the input sketch, i.e. face component, we retrive the component and perform the interpolation

# Challenges and Opportunities

- **Sketch datasets**, we need larger scale, multi-view, different levels of abstraction and deformation, scele-level, targeted for specific applications
- **Learning models specialized for sketches**, sparsity, sequential, stroke structure
- **Sketch + time**. sketch animation, sketch-based 3D animation, sketch based video editing
- **3D sketches**, 3D modelling, 3D animation
